# Limits
>[!note] Definition
>The limit of $F(t)$ as $t$ approaches $c$ is the number $L$ if:
>Given any radius $\in > 0$ about $L$ there exists a radius $\delta > 0$ about $c$ such that for all $t$ 
>
>$0<|t-c|<\delta$ implies $|F(t)-L|<\in$

We can write "The limit of $F(t)$ as $t$ approaches $c$ is $L$" as 
$$
\lim_{t\to c}F(t)=L
$$
