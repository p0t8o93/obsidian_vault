# Introduction to Functions
Look into [[Relation_Mathematics|relations]] first to better understand functions

A function can be defined as its relation has **no two ordered pairs having the same first element or [[Domain and Range|domain]]**.

Consider the relation:
$$
f: \{ (a,1),(b,2),(c,3),(d,5) \}
$$
**Mapping:**

In this example we can observe that there is no two ordered pairs with the same element. We also see that there exists ( $\exists$ ) an element $\in B,$ i.e., 4 which does not have its preimage in A. Thus here:
- The set $B$ will be termed as co-domain
- The set $\{ 1,2,3,5 \}$ is called the range

From the above we can conclude that **range is a subset of co-domain**. Symbolically this function can be written as:
$$
\begin{align}
&f:A \rightarrow B \\ \\
&A\overset{\mathrm{f}}{\longrightarrow}B
\end{align}
$$
