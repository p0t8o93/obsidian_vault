# Relation (Mathematics)
A **relation** is a set of ordered pairs, these ordered pairs are denoted as $(x,y)$ or any letter variable. In a relation there is a [[Domain and Range|domain and range]], where the first value, $x$, is the **domain** or independent variable, and the second value, $y$, is the **range** or dependent variable.

## Examples

1. $R$ is a relation from $A$ to $B$ defined by:
$$
A=\{ 2,4,5,6,7 \}~~~~~B=\{ 2,3 \}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
R&=\{ (a,b): a \in A, b \in B, and~is~divisible~by~b \} \\
 &=\{ (6,3),(2,2),(4,2),(6,2) \}
\end{aligned}
$$

2. $R$ is a relation "is greater than" from $A$ to $B$
$$
A=\{ 1,2,3,4,5 \}~~~~~B=\{ 1,2,6 \}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
R&=\{ (2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(3,2),(4,2),(5,2) \}
\end{aligned}
$$
