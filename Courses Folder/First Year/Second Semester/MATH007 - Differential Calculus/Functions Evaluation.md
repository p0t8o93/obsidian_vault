# Functions Evaluation
Evaluating functions means substituting $x$ with any real number. For instance the function $f(x)=3x+2$, we can evaluate this function at $x=4$ by substituting $x$ to 4.

$$
f(x)=3x+2
$$

$$
\begin{align}
f(4)&=3(4)+2 \\
&=12+2 \\
&=14
\end{align}
$$

Note that not all values will result to a real number. An example of this is $f(x)=\frac{5x-2}{x+4}$, this function implies that $x$ cannot be $-4$, because the answer will be undefined
