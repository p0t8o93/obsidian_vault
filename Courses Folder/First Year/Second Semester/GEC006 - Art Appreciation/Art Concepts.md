## Art Concepts
In art, **creativity** is what sets an artwork apart from another. An artist embraces originality, puts his own flavor into his work, and calls it his own creative piece.

**Imagination** is not constrained by the walls of the norm, but goes beyond that.

>An artwork does not need to be a real thing, but can be something that is imaginary (Collingwood, 1938).

Artists use their **imagination** that gives birth to reality through creation. In the same way that imagination produces art, art also inspires imagination.

Some forms of **art expression**, include visual arts, film, performance art, poetry performance, architecture, dance , literary arts, theater arts, and applied arts
