# Philosophical Perspectives on Art
**Art as an Imitation** - For plato, when one describes beauty to another person, he refers to an imperfect beauty that participates only in the form of *beauty* in the *World of Forms*.

**Art as a Representation** - Aristotle considered art as an aid to philosophy in revealing truth. It allows for the experience of pleasure. Art also has an ability to be instructive and teach its audience things about life; thus it is cognitive as well.

**Art as a Communication of Emotion** -  Art plays a huge role in communication to its audience's emotion that the artist previously experienced.

**Art for Art's Sake** - Artists associated with aestheticism believes that art needs no justification. Art does not have to be didactic or political to have social impact.
