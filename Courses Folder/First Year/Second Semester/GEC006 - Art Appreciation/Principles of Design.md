# Principles of Design
## Balance
It is the distribution of visual elements in view of their placement in relation to each other. In art, the **sense of stability** achieved through the weight of an object.

**Symmetrical** - **one side or reflected to the other** and offers the most stable visual sense to any artwork

**Asymmetrical** - are not the same, putting the heaviness on one side.

**Radial** - There is a central point in the composition, around which elements and objects are distributed.

## Scale and Proportion
**Scale** - the size in relation to what is normal for the figure or object in question

**Proportion** - is the size of the components or of objects in relation to one another when taken as a composition or a unit. It is the feeling of unity created when all parts relate well with each other.

## Contrast and Emphasis
**Contrast** is the disparity between the elements that figure into the composition and there is a large difference between two things to create interest and tension.

**Emphasis** - allows the attention of the viewer to a focal points accentuating or drawing attention to these elements or objects. This catches the viewer's attention and usually the artist will make one area stand out by contrasting it with other areas.

## Variety and Unity
**Variety** - aims to retain the interest by allowing patches or areas both excite and allow the eye to rest.

**Unity** - The compositions are intended to imbue a sense of a accord or completeness from the artwork

## Harmony
Principles of **Unity** and **Variety** are related to harmony, which elements or objects achieve a sense of flow and interconnectedness

## Rhythm
**Elements are repeated, creating implied movement**. It makes the work of art seem active and replication of elements of design creates unity within the work of art.

## Pattern
There is a sense of **predictability** that is conveyed which in turn imbues the feelings of security and calmness/
