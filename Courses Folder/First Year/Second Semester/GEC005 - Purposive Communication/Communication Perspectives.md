This models shows the speaker is the center of the communication process. The speaker delivers the message to the audience. Aristotle's Model emphasizes that there are three variables: **speaker** $\rightarrow$ **speech** $\rightarrow$ **audience**

Laswell's Model described communication being focused on the following W's: "**Who** says **What** in **Which channel** to **Whom** and with **What effect**." The whole process of communication starts with the **Communicator(who)** sending out the **message(what)** using a **medium(which channel)** for a **receiver(to whom)** experiencing an **effect(what effect)** afterward.

#### Shannon - Weaver's Communication Model

Claude Elwood Shannon's communication model **introduces the concept of noise in communication**. This model states that information is encoded and goes through a channel or transmitter. The information then is decoded by the receiver and goes to the destination. In the middle, the noise interferes with the process.

#### David Berlo's Communication Model
*David Berlo (1960)*

This model is most probably the most well-known among the communication models. Initially, this model was call **SMR** which stands for the **sender** of the **message** sent though a **channel or medium** to a **receiver**. The variables involved in the communication process are:
1. **Source**
2. **Message**
3. **Channel**
4. **Receiver**
