# Global Communication in Multicultural Setting Context

## Intercultural Communication
People interacting with those coming from unfamiliar cultures may have difficulties in communication. Most people tend to conclude that miscommunication results from the speaker's lack of proficiency in a language. What is realized is that fact that even with excellent language skills, people may still experience miscommunication

## Communicating Across Cultures
*Carol Kinsey Goman (2011)*

**Difficulty of Cross-Cultural Communication:**
- Different cultures have their own unspoken rules and assumptions that members follow naturally.
- Individuals are often unaware of their own cultural biases, making communication challenging.
- Most cultural knowledge is absorbed subconsciously, adding to the complexity.

**Increased Importance in Today's World:**
- Globalization and diverse workforces necessitate effective cross-cultural communication.
- Businesses recognize this importance for both international and domestic interactions.

**Recognizing Individuality:**
- While generalizations can provide insights, individuals within cultures still vary in their responses.

###  High-Context vs. Low-Context
- Choice of communication medium is influenced by cultural background.
- Degree of industrialization is less relevant than the high-context vs. low-context distinction.
- **High-context cultures:**
    - Mediterranean, Slav, Central European, Latin American, African, Arab, Asian, American-Indian
    - Rely heavily on context, nonverbal cues, and implied meaning.
    - Explicit communication is less crucial.
    
- **Low-context cultures:**
    - Germanic and English-speaking countries
    - Expect direct and specific messages with minimal ambiguity.
### Sequential vs. Synchronic
**Time Perception:**
- **Sequential:** View time linearly, as a commodity to manage (North America, Europe).
- **Synchronic:** View time as a flowing circle, past, present, and future interconnected (South America, Asia).

**Business Practices:**
- **Sequential:** Focused agenda, one task at a time, strict schedules.
- **Synchronic:** Flexible agenda, multi-tasking, relationships over schedules.

**Strategic Thinking:**
- **Sequential:** Short-term focus, individual effort to influence future.
- **Synchronic:** Long-term focus, understanding the present and preparing for interrelated future.

**Relationship Dynamics:**
- **Sequential:** Value individual merit, less focus on past connections.
- **Synchronic:** Strong emphasis on long-term relationships, loyalty to friends and family in business.

### Affective vs. Neutral
**Emotional expression:**
- **Affective cultures:** Readily show emotions through facial expressions, gestures, and vocal tone (Italy, France, US).
- **Neutral cultures:** Control and subdue emotional displays in business settings (Japan, UK, Netherlands).

**Impact on communication:**
- **Affective:** Seek emotional response and confirmation ("I feel the same way").
- **Neutral:** Seek agreement and focus on the idea itself ("I agree with your thoughts").

**Challenges:**
- Misunderstandings can arise when expectations differ (e.g., Dutch manager vs. Italian colleague).

**Key takeaway:**
- No single communication approach is universally "best."
- Understanding and respecting cultural differences is crucial for success in global business.

**Additional notes:**
- The passage emphasizes that neither neutral nor affective cultures are inherently better.
- The emotional acceptability spectrum varies across cultures (Japan least, Italy most accepting).
- Effective communication requires adapting your style to the cultural context.
