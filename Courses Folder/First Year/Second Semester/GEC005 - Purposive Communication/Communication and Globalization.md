Its  an **economic concept**, the integration of markets, trade, and investments with few barriers to slow the flow of products and service between nations. There is also a cultural element, as ideas and traditions are traded and assimilated

Globalization has brought many benefits to many people, but not for everyone.

### How did Globalization happen?
Globalization has been around for centuries, one example is the Silk Road when trade spread rapidly between China and Europe via an overland route. Merchants carried goods for a trade back and forth, trading silk as well as precious metals and spices.

The internet has revolutionized connectivity and communication, and helped people share their ideas much more widely/

The invention of enormous container ships helped too. In fact, improvements in transport generally allowed us to move around the globe much more easily

### What's good about it?
Globalization has led to many millions of people being lifted out of poverty.

An example is Starbucks buying coffee from farmers in Rwanda, it is providing a livelihood and a benefit to the community as a whole.

The presence of a multinational company overseas contributes to those local economies because the company invests in local resources, products and services. 

Globalization has not only allowed nations to trade with each other, but also cooperate with each other as never before. An example is the *Paris Agreement on Climate Change*, where 195 countries agreed to work towards reducing their carbon emissions for the greater global good
