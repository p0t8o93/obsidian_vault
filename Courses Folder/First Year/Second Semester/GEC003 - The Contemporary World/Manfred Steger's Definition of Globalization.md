## Manfred Steger's Definition of Globalization
Manfred Steger describes globalization as a process.
- It refers to the **expansion** and **intensification** of social relations and consciousness across world-time and word-space
	- **Expansion**: refers to both the creation of new social networks and the multiplication of existing connections that cut across traditional, political, economic, cultural, and geographic boundaries.
	- **Intensification**: refers to the expansion, stretching and acceleration of these networks. Not only are global connections multiplying, they also become more closely-knit and expanding their reach.

**Globalization** represents the many processes that allow for the expansion and intensification of global connections.

**Globalism** is a widespread belief among powerful people that the global integration of economic markets is beneficial for everyone , since it spreads freedom and democracy across the world.
