# Economic Globalization
Economic globalization is an irreversible trend. Economic globalization refers to the increasing interdependence of world economies as a result of the growing scale of cross-border trade of commodities and services, flow on international capital and wide and rapid spread of technologies.

There is also an increased **speed and frequency of trading**. At present, supercomputers execute millions of stock purchases and sales between different cities in a matter of seconds through a process called **high frequency trading** 

## International Monetary Fund (IMF)
- Describes the economic globalization as the historical process representing the result of human innovation and technological progress
- Characterized by the **increasing integration of economies** around the world.
- **IMF** - the value of trade (goods and service) increased as percentage of world GDP

## Factors of Economic Globalization
1) Rapid development of science and technology
	- growth of communication & transportation
2) Market - Oriented reform
	- a policy measure that allows and induces the competitive participation
	- of private agents in a sector
	
## Types of economic integration
**Political Union** - different forms of federal systems are incorporated. (i.e. The European Union that consists of 27 countries)

**Fiscal Union** - decisions about taxation and public expenditure are largely taken by common institutions: 
- Distribution of income and wealth among different segments of the population
**Monetary Union** -  a zone where a single monetary policy prevails in a single currency which circulate freely
- The United States is part of formal monetary union known as the compact of free association
- Have a single/central common bank system
	
>**Difference between fiscal and monetary union**
**Fiscal Policy** - governments usually **raise taxes "directly" or indirectly** as economic growth weakens, a government can *-for example-* raise expenditure without an offsetting increase in taxation.
>- mainly revenue raising to impact a number of aspects of the economy
>
>**Monetary Policy** - central bank activities that are directed toward influencing the quantity of money and credit in an economy. The central bank should have a degree of independence from the government

**Common Market** is a formal agreement where a group is formed amongst several countries that adopt a common external *tariff*.
	- *tariff*: a form of tax imposed on imported goods and services
	- Production factors are able to move freely without restriction among members
	- Common trade restrictions such as *tariffs* on countries outside the group are adapted by all members
	- All barriers regarding importing 

**Customs Union** -  also eliminates trade restrictions among members and establishes a common external tariff to non-members.

**Free Trade** - also eliminates barriers but members maintain individual trade policies with non-members.

**Preferential Trade** - **reduces** tariffs and provide other trade advantages and privileges to specific countries or regions.

**Interdependent Union** - refers to a labor union that operates autonomously and is not directly controlled or influenced by the government or employer.
- It's concept is technically not a stage of economic integration, but it plays an important role when considering labor standards. The **protections of worker's rights** are often addressed in parallel with economic integration to ensure a balanced process.

## Arturo Giraldez & Denis Flynn
They stated that globalization when **important populated continents** began to exchange products continuously - both with each other **directly & indirectly** via other continents and in values **sufficient** to generate crucial impacts on all trading partners.

## International Trading System
#### Silk Trade (130 BCE - 1453 C.E.)
> China, Middle East, Europe

The oldest known international trade route it was closed by the Ottoman Empire. The most **profitable products** traded through this network was **Silk**

#### Galleon Trade (1571)
> Manila of Philippines, Acapulco Mexico

The Galleon Trade was a part of the age of [[mercantilism]]. This was the first time that the **Americans were directly connected to Asian trading routes**. 

### 16-18th Century
**Period of Mercantilism** -  A system of global trade with multiple restrictions

Countries in Europe with one another sell more goods as  a mean to boost their country's income called **monetary reserves**

To defend their products, regimes (mainly monarchies) imposed high tariffs, forbade colonies to trade with other nations, restricted trade routes, and subsidized exports.

### 19th Century
In 1867 an open trade system emerged. The Unites States and United Kingdom adopted the  **gold standard** at international monetary conference in Paris

#### Gold Trade (1867)
> US, UK, European Countries

The UK, US, and other EU nations adopted the gold standard as a **common basis for currency and fixed exchange-rate system - all based on the value of gold**

### 20th Century
The world economy operates based on what are called **fiat currencies** - currencies that are not backed by precious metals and whose value is determined by their cost relative to other countries

**Fiat Currencies** -  a system that "allows governments to freely and actively manage their economies by increasing or decreasing the amount of money in circulation as they see fit"

## The Bretton Woods System
Inaugurated in 1944 during the **United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference.**

Largely influenced by British economist **John Maynard Keynes** who assumed:
- that economic crisis occur not when a country does not have money, but when money is not being spend and thereby not moving.
- If the economies slow down then the government should infuse money to reinvigorate the market
- As prices of commodities increased, companies would earn more, and would have more money to hire workers. 
### 2 Financial Institutions Created by Delegates of Bretton Woods Conference:
**International Bank for Reconstruction and Development - IBRD or World Bank** - responsible for funding postwar reconstruction projects.

**International Monetary Fund - IMF** - the global lender of last resort to prevent individual countries from spiraling into credit crises

Both institutions remain key players in economic globalization

Shortly after Bretton Woods, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was created in 1947. The main purpose was to reduce tariffs and other hindrances to free trade.
