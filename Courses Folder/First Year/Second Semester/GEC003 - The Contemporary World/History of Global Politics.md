# History of Global Politics: Creating an International Order
What does the word *politics mean*?

***Politics*** 
- The activities associated with the governance of a country or other area. especially the debate or conflict among individuals. 
- The activities of governments concerning the political relations between countries
- The academic study of government and the state

**International relations** refers to the study of the political, military, and other diplomatic engagements between two or more states.

**Internationalization** refers to the deepening interactions between or among states.

### How does internationalization differ from globalization?
Internationalization refers to the deepening of interactions between states. Globalization of politics refers to the multiple interactions or relations between states.

**Internationalization** does not equal globalization; it is rather a **major part of globalization**. The international relations of states today can be largely defined by the events as far as 400 years ago.

## Attributes of Today's Global System
According to Claudio et al. (2018, p. 27), there are four attributes of today's global system.
1. There are countries or states that are independent and govern themselves.
2. Countries interact with each other through diplomacy.
3. There are international organizations, like the United Nations (UN) that facilitate the interactions.
4. International organizations also take on lives of their own

### Difference between nation and state?
- The nation-state is composed of two non-interchangeable terms.
- Not all states are nations and not all nations are states.
-  E.g. Scotland has its own flag and national culture; however, it belongs to a state called the United Kingdom.
- There are states with multiple nations, there are also single nations with multiple states.
- E.g. Korea as a nation is divided into North and South, Chinese nation refers to both the People’s Republic of China (Mainland) and Taiwan.

State refers to a country and its government. It has four attributes: 
1) It exercises authority over a specific population (citizens). 
2) It governs a specific territory 
3) It has a structure of government and crafts various rules that people follow.
4) It has *sovereignty* over its territory. *Sovereignty* refers internal and external authority.

Nation is defined as an "imagined community" or group of people who shared a common culture, language, history etc. (Benedict Anderson)

## The Interstate System
### The Treaty of Westphalia
The origins of the present-day concept of sovereignty can be traced back to the Treaty of Westphalia, which was a set of agreements signed in 1648 to end the Thirty Years' War between the major continental powers of Europe. After the brutal religious war between Catholics and Protestants, the *Holy Roman Empire*, *Spain*, *France*, *Sweden,* and the *Dutch Republic* designed a system that would avert wars in the future by recognizing that the treaty signers exercise complete control over their domestic affairs and swear not to meddle in each other's affairs.

**Westphalian system** - a system that gives stability to European nations through direct control of their domestic activities - free from interference of other nations.

### Napoleon Bonaparte
Napoleon Bonaparte challenged the Westphalian system. He spreads the principles of the French Revolution - liberty, fraternity, and equality - to the rest of Europe and thus challenged the power of kings, nobility, and religion in Europe.

The Napoleonic Wars lasted from **1803 - 1815** with Napoleon and his armies marching all over much of Europe

**Napoleonic Code** - a principle that spread "liberty", "equality" and "fraternity" as themes for creation of new form of government in France.

### The Concert of Europe Systems
It was an **alliance of great powers** - The **United Kingdom**, **Austria**, **Russia**, and **Prussia**. They sought to restore the world of monarchical, hereditary, and religious **privileges of the time before the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars**. Austrian diplomat **Klemens von Metternich** was the **system's main architect**.

**Metternich system**-  an alliance of "great powers" - United Kingdoms, Austria, and Prussia that restored monarchical, hereditary, and religious privileges of rulers.

## Internationalism
Internationalism is an imagined system of heightened interaction between various sovereign states particularly the desire for greater cooperation and unity among states and people. It comes in different forms, but the principle may be divided into two broad categories: *liberal internationalism* and *socialist internationalism*.

### Liberal Internationalism
Achievement: Foundation of United Nation

Proponents:
1. Immanuel Kant - argues that citizens in the state must give up some freedom and establish a continuously growing state consisting of various nations which will ultimately include the nations of the world".   Since, if there is no form of world government then international system will be chaotic. 
2. Jeremy Bentham- says that the objectives of the global legislators should aim to propose legislation that would create " the greatest happiness of all nations taken together".
3. Giuseppe Mazzini- believes that free, unified nation-state should be the basis of global cooperation.
4. Woodrow Wilson- forwarded the principle of self-determination and advocate for the creation of League of Nations to prevent a world war II.

## Socialist internationalism

Achievement:  Declaration of International women's Day and Labor Day

1. **Karl Marx** -claimed a premium economic equality among the classes of citizens in the world. 
2. **Friedrich Engels and  Karl Marx** established a socialist revolution through a battle cry "Workers of the world, Unite! you have nothing to lose but your chains."     
3. **Vladimir Lenin** - established the communist international (Comintern) in 1919 to serve as central body for directing communist parties all over the world. 
4. **Stalin** re-stablished the Comintern as Communist Information Bureau (Cominform) in order to direct the various communist parties that had taken power in Eastern Europe.
