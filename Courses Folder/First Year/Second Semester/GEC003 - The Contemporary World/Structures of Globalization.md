# Structures of Globalization
To start we must first what globalization is. Globalization is the process of **interaction** and **integration** among the people, companies and governments of different nations. This process is driven by **international trade** and **investment** and aided by **information technology.**

Globalization has its effects on the environment, on culture, on political systems, on economic development and prosperity, and on human physical well-being in societies around the world.
