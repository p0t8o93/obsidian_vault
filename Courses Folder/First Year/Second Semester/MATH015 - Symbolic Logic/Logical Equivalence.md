# Logical Equivalence
## Biconditional Proposition
Let $p$ and $q$ be propositions
- The proposition '$p$ if and only if $q$ is called the *biconditional proposition*
- In symbols, $p \leftrightarrow q$
- Other semantic words for $\leftrightarrow$:
	- *when and only when*
	- *equivalent to*

### Truth Functionality of Biconditional Proposition
$p \leftrightarrow q$ is **1** when the two propositions have the **same truth value**

## Logical Equivalence
If $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the propositions and $p_1 \leftrightarrow P_2$ is *tautology*, then $P_1$ is logically equivalent to $P_2$
- In symbols $P_1 \equiv P_2$
- In practical sense, equivalent propositions are statements that have **the same meaning** but they are expressed **in different ways**
