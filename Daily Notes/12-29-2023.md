## Journal
At the beginning if the day I went and started with listing my to do list.  

I am writing this currently at 8:19pm, and I did not finish the things I want to do for the day. That is because it took me a long time just to finish the revised design of the 3D Model which I finished I think around 6pm which sucks man. I wanted to practice piano since I have a lesson tomorrow. Well goodluck tomorrow me I hope it goes well...
