## Journal
Today I started revising my way of using Obsidian to make it more fit my taste and adjust things to my liking. I created a note that will serve as a guide for me manage and organize my notes and utilize the [[Zettelkasten Notes]] which I have yet to fill out the file with useful information. This maybe short but this is a start for me to become productive.
