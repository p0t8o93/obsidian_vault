## Things to do

## Events of Today
I played the piano from I think 11pm to 12pm, and the next session is in January 5, 2024. 
## Journal
I am just going to write what is on my mind write now. I don't know what I would write for today, so here I am writing this hopefully get some ideas.

I should really start reading the calculus book given to me, because I have yet to refresh my memory on topics regarding basic calculus up to differential calculus which is still basic calculus but I digress. What I need to do now since I started a new vault revising my own Zettelkasten method, is to create a folder for self study topics and put in their the name of the book which I will put into a note. This note will contain chapters 1 and 2 of the calculus books which covers I what I would need for differential calculus.

In this self study folder I hope that it wont just be filled with academics or something related to school, I would like to also use it for some topics that I would want to learn more about like **OSINT** and yeah... This will be a start.
