Today is going to be the second time I will be following my calendar which I planned out yesterday, hopefully I can manage myself to follow it and also be able to manage my time more wisely instead of wasting all the time. Currently I have nothing to write about yet since it is the morning and don't have any thoughts on doing anything yet but follow my calendar/schedule for the day.

I have watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5RO4Xsw9Ec) about a way to share my obsidian notes through the internet using and plugin call [Obsius Publish](https://github.com/jonstodle/obsius-obsidian-plugin). This publishes the notes I want to share to others like my lecture notes and some other notes that could be helpful, though the limitation of this is that it will only publish that specific note. This becomes a problem if I want to share a web of notes that is linked to each other.

Maybe I could go on in this format?

I think I can do this format, I will follow the format where in each Course I will create another note which will contain the links of each lecture notes I have. Or I can just compile it in a new note which has all the courses then I will list the links instead of having separate notes for each subject. This will help to in making sure I can share my notes in a easy way.
