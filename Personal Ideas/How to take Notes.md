# How to take Notes
I will write my thoughts on how I should manage and organize my notes in obsidian to increase my productivity and also improve my academics. 

To start, I should always keep notes during lectures by writing and also taking a picture of the board, this includes other resources like a page or something similar. After writing down or having notes of the lectures, after school take down these notes into obsidian. You don't have to copy it one to one, make it your notes, write it in you own way. 

Now that I have stated what I will need to do, make sure that you implement your own way of the [[Zettelkasten Notes]], which is to link other notes together to get a broader perspective of the topic.
## Folders
Utilize folders to keep track of where every note is stored. Create different folders for each course and follow the folder name format of "`Course_code-Name_of_Course`". Create different folders for different contexts like a folder for piano lessons, journals, and the like.
## Embeds and Links
Put in embeds or links to different notes or ideas so that later you can expand upon those ideas. Linking or referencing a keyword within the note is okay even if there is no file for it yet. You can create it later on.
## Structure of Notes for Academics/School
This upcoming semester I want you to follow this structure for linking and embedding notes and media.

Start of with a note of the course, this note will contain a brief description of the course and the syllabus, **MAKE SURE TO WRITE THE SYLLABUS DOWN THIS TIME.** After writing down the syllabus in the course note, link or embed the corresponding lecture notes to each mentioned in the syllabus that way you can track which lesson you are currently on and know what lesson is next

Now that the lecture notes are linked to the course, tasks, assignments, or activities are next. Create notes for each activity and link them to the topics covered in that activity.
