# My Productivity System
This will be a guide and an outline on what my productivity system will be. A productivity system are practices, tools, and techniques that helps manage tasks, goals, things to do, and the like. 

What I want in my productivity system is that the tools or applications that I will be using are free and have a flexible free plan. For now I will list the apps and programs I am going to use for this productivity system:
- **Calendar** - Google Calendar
- **Notes (Digital)** - Obsidian
- **To do list** - Todoist
As you can see there is only three tools I am using so maybe in the future I will update this soon, hopefully.

## Planning
First step for this productivity system is to plan out my whole week, recommended during the weekends or start of the week. For planning what I want to do for the week, I use Google Calendar which is free and accessible in my laptop and phone. This helps to keep tabs on what I will do for the day and such. 

After planning out things in my calendar I will then use Todoist for creating a more specific list of things to do for the day. For example in my calendar I set a time for studying calculus, in my Todoist I will create a task which specifically tells the topic/s that I will be covering in my study session.
## Notes
The use case of notes is not really just for school, it can be anything I want to write about, like right now. I am creating a note for how I want my productivity system to be.

For notes, this will be primarily be focused on school and academics since I am a college student. I am going to use Obsidian as for my digital notes and traditional written notes for when I am in campus listening to lectures and such. During lectures I will be writing down notes and later on the day, after school I will organize these notes to Obsidian and relearn the things taught during the lectures.

Not only note taking be done for lecture notes, I will also be taking notes for other sources like the book for calculus I have. I will be using that book to advance read and relearn calculus for the upcoming 2nd semester so yeah.
