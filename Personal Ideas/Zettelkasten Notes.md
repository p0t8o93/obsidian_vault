# Zettelkasten Note Taking
#### Unorganized thoughts/ Highlights
	A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.

Creator of the Zettelkasten method is [[Niklas Luhmann]]. 

The Zettelkasten method is popularized by [[Niklas Luhmann]], who is a German sociologist. The word Zettelkasten is a German word meaning "*note box*". 

The Zettelkasten method is a way to store and organize knowledge and build upon it by linking or creating new ideas.

Traits of Zettelkasten:
- It's hyper-textual
	- It is not just a single or collection of texts, but these texts refer to each other, new ideas which is used to expand previous knowledge by relating them to one another. What is important is connecting ideas and not collecting
	- You connect ideas
- [[Principle of Atomicity]]
	- Each Zettel or note only contains one unit of knowledge, these units are called atoms
- It is personal
	- Zettelkasten is designed to be personal, you manage how you create your web of thought. Each person is different, and there is one Zettelkasten per person and one person per Zettelkasten, meaning that a Zettelkasten is something that you can play around with and change things the way you like.
	- You create your own Zettelkasten that fits your needs and workflow

>I don't understand yet the principle of atomicity, I will need to get back to it later.

In creating a Zettlel or note it should contain these three things, a unique identifier, body, and reference/s. A unique identifier is required since you will use it to find and surf through your notes and find links and connections. This identifier can be the date created, title, tags, and the like. 

	I have yet to create my own series of identifiers and changes will be made in the future.
The body contains the knowledge and information. In writing a Zettel it is essential that you use your own words, to make it more personal and also helps you learn and recall the material better.
